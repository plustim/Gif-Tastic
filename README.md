# Gif-Tastic

You can view the finished page by following
[this link](https://plustim.github.io/Gif-Tastic/)

or alternatively you can check out a potentially
[superior version](https://plustim.github.io/Gif-Tastic/better.html)
that uses HTML5 videos.

(Video elements can make use of MP4 files provided by Giphy, which are often times smaller files than GIF's, plus there is better functionality built into video elements.)

This app makes use of the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/).
